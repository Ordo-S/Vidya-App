# Vidya-App
This is a prototype "News" site built off Django and deployed to heroku.  The site was built with the intention of having high modularity and expandability. This web app was approached with MVC in mind.  To see the final product please visit https://vidya131.herokuapp.com/catalog/

*Please note that some images may not work on the site, as I was lazy and just imported links instead of adding imaged to DB*
